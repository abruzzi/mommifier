### Mommify Requirement

#### TL;DR

You are given strings of different lengths. If the number of vowels are more than 30% of the string length then replace "mommy" for each continuous set of vowels.

#### Examples

1.	"hmm" will become "hmm" (no vowels)
2.	"his" will become "hmommys" (vowels are more than 30%)
3.	"hear" will become "hmommyr" and not "hmommymommyr" (continuous set of vowels)
